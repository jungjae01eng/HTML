# HTML_CSS-2016
These are my projects from Computer Science class in middle school, where I learned basic HTML and CSS for the first time.
Before taking this class, I had never thought of pursuing software/computer engineering, so these codes in the repository were life-changing.
None of these codes are fully completed, but I believe each project shows improvement.
I plan not to fix any of these codes because seeing the change is nice, but feel free to check out my HTML/CSS codes in different repositories.
